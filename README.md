EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS ABOUT THE ACCIDENTS HAPPENING IN USA
#RECOMMENDATION :
1. Targeted Road Safety Campaigns: States with a high number of drivers involved in fatal collisions per billion miles driven, such as Arkansas, Kentucky, Montana, and Alabama, should prioritize road safety awareness campaigns. These campaigns should focus on promoting safe driving practices, addressing speeding, and discouraging impaired driving.

2. Distracted Driving Initiatives: States with a low percentage of drivers who were not distracted during fatal collisions, such as Mississippi, should implement stricter laws and enforcement measures against distracted driving. Educational programs and public awareness campaigns can also help mitigate the risks associated with distracted driving.

3.Insurance Premium Adjustments: States with higher car insurance premiums, such as New Jersey, District of Columbia, Delaware, and Florida, should evaluate the factors contributing to these high premiums. Insurance companies may need to adjust their pricing models or implement risk-based pricing strategies to ensure fair and competitive rates.

4. Driver Education and Training: States with a high percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who had previous accidents, such as Kentucky, Michigan, and New Jersey, should consider enhancing driver education and training programs. These programs could focus on defensive driving techniques, risk awareness, and promoting responsible driving behavior.

5. Claims Management Strategies: States where insurance companies incur higher losses per insured driver, such as Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, and Connecticut, should analyze the underlying causes and develop strategies to mitigate these losses. This could involve implementing stricter underwriting guidelines, offering incentives for safe driving, or investing in fraud detection and prevention measures.

6. Collaboration and Information Sharing: States should collaborate and share best practices, successful initiatives, and lessons learned in addressing road safety issues, distracted driving, impaired driving, and other contributing factors to fatal collisions. This collective effort can accelerate the adoption of effective strategies and enhance overall road safety across the nation.
